It is located within walking distance from the central Vake Park. The apartment building is bordered from south by the hill that houses another beloved recreational area - the Turtle Lake. Thus the air is always fresh and clean, despite central location in the heart of the city. The immediate area is also very quiet, as it sits off the main roads, in a quiet “bay”.\r\nThe building itself is solid and reliable, as it was constructed by the communists for the Tbilisi Water Company staff – such buildings are considered by many as the most reliable in Tbilisi today.","details":{"daily_rent":null,"for_rent":"1000 $ / 10.53 $ m²","for_sale":null,"for_lease":null,"est_lease_price":null,"rent_price":"1000","rent_price_currency":"$","rent_price_sq_meter":"10.53","rent_price_dollars":1000.0,"rent_price_sq_meter_dollars":10.53,"rent_price_exchange_rate_to_dollars":1.0,"sale_price":null,"sale_price_currency":null,"sale_price_sq_meter":null,"sale_price_dollars":null,"sale_price_sq_meter_dollars":null,"sale_price_exchange_rate_to_dollars":null,"space":"95","space_measurement":"sq.m.","land":null,"land_measurement":null,"renovation":"Newly renovated","view":null,"project":"Nonstandard","condition":null,"function":null,"address":"Tbilisi, Vake-Saburtalo,  Vake, T.
