This 160 m2 apartment is located on the top floor of a typical Tbilisi style three story brick building from the 1930’s. It blends a modern layout with a classical touch. The living area, dining and kitchen are integrated which gives a large open, inviting and light feeling. The custom fitted vintage looking kitchen is generous for the cooking interested with a central cooking island and a large stove. The ceiling height is well above three meters with large double doors separating the rooms.\r\nWhile an old house, the standard will give you comfort and hassle free living. A complete overhaul was done in 2006 including new heating, water and electricity system and double glass windows that keep noise away. \r\nThe apartment has two balconies on either side of the house. The larger balcony towards the yard is a real oasis during summer nights and long dining. \r\nIt has been well maintained by three previous diplomatic tenants. The apartment is unfurnished apart from some few items.","details":{"daily_rent":null,"for_rent":"2500 $ / 15.34 $ m²","for_sale":null,"for_lease":null,"est_lease_price":null,"rent_price":"2500","rent_price_currency":"$","rent_price_sq_meter":"15.34","rent_price_dollars":2500.0,"rent_price_sq_meter_dollars":15.34,"rent_price_exchange_rate_to_dollars":1.0,"sale_price":null,"sale_price_currency":null,"sale_price_sq_meter":null,"sale_price_dollars":null,"sale_price_sq_meter_dollars":null,"sale_price_exchange_rate_to_dollars":null,"space":"163","space_measurement":"sq.m.","land":null,"land_measurement":null,"renovation":"Renovated","view":null,"project":null,"condition":null,"function":null,"address":"Tbilisi, Old Tbilisi,  Vera, Janashia st.","address_city":"Tbilisi","address_area":"Old Tbilisi","address_district":"Vera","address_street":"Janashia st.","address_number":null,"phone":"00258847605311;","cadastral":null},"specs":{"all_floors":"3","floor":"3","rooms":"4","bedrooms":"3","conference_room":null,"suites":null,"wc":"2","bathroom":"1","shower":"1","fireplace":"1","air_conditioner":"1","balcony":"2","veranda":null,"loft":null,"bodrum":null,"mansard":null,"parking":null,"garage":null,"dist_from_tbilisi":null,"dist_from_cent_street":null,"box":null,"buildings":null,"administration_building":null,"workroom":null,"stockroom":null,"coefficient_k1":null,"coefficient_k2":null}}
